# 🚦 Traffic Flow Optimization Using Computer Vision

This project aims to optimize traffic signal timing using real-time computer vision and image analysis. By detecting the number of vehicles at each traffic signal, the system dynamically allocates green light duration based on real-time congestion levels, improving traffic flow and reducing unnecessary waiting times.

## 📌 Features

* 🧠 **Vehicle detection using computer vision** (YOLO, OpenCV, or similar)
* 🎥 **Real-time video/image feed processing**
* ⏱️ **Adaptive signal timing** based on vehicle count
* 📊 **Logs and displays traffic density** for analysis
* ⚙️ **Scalable** to multi-lane and multi-signal intersections

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used

* Python
* OpenCV
* YOLO / TensorFlow / any preferred object detection model
* NumPy / Pandas
* Flask (optional: for web dashboard/API)
* Raspberry Pi / Jetson Nano (optional: for edge deployment)

## 📷 How It Works

1. **Capture Input**: Live video feed from traffic signal cameras.
2. **Detect Vehicles**: Use object detection to count vehicles per lane.
3. **Calculate Signal Time**: More vehicles = longer green light time.
4. **Control Signal**: Send control signal to traffic lights accordingly.

## 📥 Data Collection

Live video feeds from traffic signal cameras are ingested and processed in real time. Using object detection models (e.g., YOLO, SSD), vehicles are detected and counted for each lane. Each data point includes:

* **Timestamp**
* **Vehicle count per lane**
* **Total traffic density**
* **Intersection ID** (if applicable)

This data is stored locally or on the cloud for further analysis, system performance monitoring, and future model training or predictive analytics.
